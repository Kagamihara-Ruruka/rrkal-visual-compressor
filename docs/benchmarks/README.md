# Benchmark Evidence

This folder stores small, reviewable benchmark artifacts that can be rerun from
the CLI. These files are not raw datasets; they are compact evidence snapshots
for validating compression claims.

## Artifacts

- `smooth_100k_terms_sweep.json`: machine-readable benchmark evidence for a
  100,000-sample smooth synthetic series with Fourier terms `32,64,96`.
- `smooth_100k_terms_sweep.md`: human-readable summary of the same run.

## Current Reading

The smooth 100k terms sweep shows that all tested Fourier term counts beat both
SVG.gz and source CSV.gz under an R2 gate of `0.99`.

The practical sweet spot is not just the smallest package. In this run, `32`
terms has the best size ratio but under-covers the channel band. `96` terms is
slightly larger but reaches `package_preferred_against_gzip`, so it is the
better current default for channel-backed visual assets.
